## 📌 Project Overview

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images are captured in grayscale format and lack visual interpretability compared to optical images.

This project presents a **Deep Learning-based SAR Image Colorization system** that enhances grayscale SAR images into realistic color representations using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

The system improves visualization, interpretation, and analytical insight of satellite imagery for:

- 🌊 Water body detection  
- 🏙 Urban area mapping  
- 🌾 Agricultural monitoring  
- 🛰 Remote sensing analysis  
- 🛡 Defense & surveillance

## 🎯 Problem Statement

SAR images are highly informative but difficult to interpret visually because they are grayscale and contain speckle noise.

Manual analysis requires expertise.

👉 Our solution automatically colorizes SAR images using a Deep Learning model to enhance interpretability and visual clarity.
